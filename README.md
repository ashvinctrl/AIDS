# 🛡️ AI Intrusion Detection System v2.0
*Because your network deserves better than a "password123" defense strategy*

![Dashboard Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1a1a1a/60a5fa?text=AI+Intrusion+Detection+Dashboard)

> **Warning**: This system is so good at detecting threats, it might flag your cat walking across the keyboard as a "sophisticated feline-based attack vector." 🐱‍💻

## 🎭 **What Is This Thing?**

Ever wondered what would happen if you gave a computer a PhD in paranoia and a caffeine addiction? Well, wonder no more! This AI Intrusion Detection System is like having a digital bouncer for your network - except this bouncer never sleeps, never gets tired, and definitely never lets suspicious packets sweet-talk their way past security.

Think of it as the Sherlock Holmes of cybersecurity, but with better charts and fewer pipe-smoking breaks.

## ✨ **Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!"**

### 🤖 **AI So Smart, It Makes Your Smart TV Look Dumb**
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Isolation Forest (no trees were harmed in the making)
- **Real-time Analysis**: Faster than your reaction to a pizza delivery notification
- **Threat Classification**: Can tell the difference between a DDoS attack and your teenager downloading TikToks
- **Confidence Scoring**: More confident than a developer saying "it works on my machine"
- **Automated Response**: Blocks threats faster than you can say "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

### 🔒 **Security Tighter Than Your Jeans After Thanksgiving**
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens so secure, even the NSA would be impressed
- **Rate Limiting**: Stops script kiddies faster than a parent stops a tantrum
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes data better than your germaphobe friend sanitizes everything
- **Security Headers**: More layers than an onion (and less likely to make you cry)
- **Encrypted Communication**: So encrypted, even we sometimes forget what we're saying

### ⚡ **Performance Faster Than Your Excuses**
- **Optimized React**: Renders faster than your regret after clicking "Reply All"
- **Redis Caching**: Caches data like a squirrel hoards nuts for winter
- **Batch Processing**: Handles data in batches like a cookie factory (but for threats)
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates faster than your social media feed during drama
- **Code Splitting**: Splits code better than a magician splits cards

### 📊 **Dashboard Prettier Than Your Instagram Feed**
- **Real-time Charts**: So real-time, they show threats before they even think about attacking
- **System Metrics**: Monitors everything except your questionable life choices
- **Threat Intelligence**: Smarter than that one friend who always has "insider information"
- **Filtering & Search**: Find threats faster than you find excuses to avoid meetings
- **Export Features**: Export data faster than you export your problems to someone else

*It's like a three-way friendship where everyone actually gets along and does their job properly.*

## 🚀 **Getting Started (Don't Panic!)**

### **Option 1: Docker (For the Lazy... I Mean Efficient)**

Perfect for people who think "dependency hell" is a real place and want to avoid visiting it.

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-intrusion-detection.git
   cd ai-intrusion-detection
   # Congratulations! You've successfully copied and pasted. You're basically a hacker now.
   ```

2. **Set up your secrets (shh! 🤫):**
   ```bash
   cp ai-intrusion-detection/backend/.env.example ai-intrusion-detection/backend/.env
   # Edit .env with your super-secret API keys (no, "password123" doesn't count)
   ```

3. **Launch the rockets:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   # Sit back and watch the magic happen (or grab coffee while Docker does its thing)
   ```

4. **Access your new digital fortress:**
   - 🌐 **Frontend**: http://localhost *(where the magic happens)*
   - 🔧 **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 *(where the real magic happens)*
   - 📚 **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs *(where you pretend to read documentation)*

### **Option 2: Manual Setup (For the B
cd ai-intrusion-detection/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 📖 **How It Works**

### **1. Data Collection**
```python
# Network logs are collected from various sources
logs = [
    {
        "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
        "dst_ip": "10.0.0.1", 
        "bytes": 1500,
        "packets": 10,
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
]
```

### **2. AI Analysis**
```python
# ML model analyzes patterns
features = extract_features(logs)  # bytes/packet, time patterns, etc.
threat_score = isolation_forest.predict(features)
confidence = calculate_confidence(threat_score)
```

### **3. Threat Classification**
```python
# Intelligent threat categorization
if high_bytes_low_packets: return "DDoS"
elif many_packets_small_bytes: return "Port Scan"  
elif unusual_data_patterns: return "Data Exfiltration"
```

### **4. Real-time Response**
```python
# Automated response based on threat level
if threat_level == "high":
    block_ip(source_ip)
    send_alert(security_team)
    log_incident(threat_details)
```

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Security
API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here
SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-here

# Database
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# ML Settings
MODEL_CONTAMINATION=0.1
MODEL_N_ESTIMATORS=200

# Performance
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60
```

## 📊 **API Documentation**

{
  "logs": [
    {
      "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "dst_ip": "10.0.0.1",
      "bytes": 1500,
      "packets": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

{
  "results": [
    {
      "src_ip": "192.168.1.100",
      "threat_score": 0.85,
      "is_threat": true,
      "threat_type": "DDoS",
